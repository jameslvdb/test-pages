# Howdy!

I'm currently a Software Engineer at USAA, where I build software to support the company's operational messaging. I currently build microservices in Spring Boot with Java and Groovy, as well as frontend work with React. For my personal projects, I'm mostly building apps in Ruby on Rails or Elixir and Phoenix.
